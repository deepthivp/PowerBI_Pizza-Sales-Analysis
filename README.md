🌟 Excited to unveil my latest Power BI project: Pizza Sales Analysis! 🍕
Delving into the data revealed some eye-opening insights:
📊 Total Sales: Pizza sales soared to an impressive $817K over the past year, underscoring robust consumer demand. 
🍕 Top-Selling Pizzas: The Thai Chicken, California Chicken, and Barbecue Chicken varieties dominated sales, guiding strategic promotional campaigns. 📈 Peak Sales Times: Afternoons and evenings emerged as peak periods, suggesting targeted weekend offers could drive even higher sales.

This project deepened my analytics skills and provided actionable business intelligence for enhancing pizza sales strategies.
